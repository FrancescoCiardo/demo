Yann LeCun spent his early life in France, growing up in the suburbs of Paris. (His name was originally Le Cun, but he dropped the space after discovering that Americans were confused and treated Le as his middle name). His father was an engineer, whose interests in electronics and mechanics were passed on to Yann during a boyhood of tinkering. As a teenager he enjoyed playing in a band as well as science and engineering. He remained in the region to study, earning the equivalent of a masters’ degree from the École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs en Électrotechnique et Électronique, one of France’s network of competitive and specialized non-university schools established to train to the country’s future elite. His work there focused on microchip design and automation.
