TA winner: **Bengio**

Cosa è il TA(Turing Award)?
Turing Award (in italiano, premio Turing) è un premio, assegnato annualmente dalla Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), a una personalità che eccelle per i contributi di natura tecnica offerti alla comunità informatica, in particolare per progressi che siano duraturi e di elevata importanza tecnica.

**Yoshua Bengio** was born to two college students in Paris, France. His parents had rejected their traditional Moroccan Jewish upbringings to embrace the 1960s counterculture’s focus on personal freedom and social solidarity.  He attributes his comfort in following his “scientific intuition” to this upbringing.[1]In search of a more inclusive society, the family moved to Montreal, in the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec, when Yoshua was twelve years old.
